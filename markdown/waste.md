# Waste

There are only two things that we can do to improve the performance of a program:

1. Reduce the total number instrucctions for CPU to execute

2. Make instructions move more effiently through the CPU.

Thats it, reduce the number or make it fast.

The biggest multiplier that makes the code slow is: **WASTE**. It makes program 1k to 10k times slower. Waste means literal waste. Those are the instructions that we dont want but CPU is executing and wasting it's resources and time. In modern times it's more common.

The job of CPU is to execute instructions. CPUs take very simple instructions like ADD. It takes two registers or memory addresses as input. It adds those number and overwrites the first memory with the result. So ` A = A + B ` or ` A += B `

In x86 there are other ways too like LEA. But it's slightly diffrent. On form takes two sources and a destination like ` C = A + B `

So now the question is :
> How many wasted instructions are there in a simple A+B python program?

It's very simple program just add A and B. And let's compare it with C program.

```c
int __declspec(noinline) add(int A, int B)
{
   return(A+B);
} 

#pragma optimize("", off)
int main(int ArgCount, char Args)
{
   return add(1234, 5678);
}
```

This is because we don't want the C compiler to aggressivly optimize the code remove the addition instruction. All we told the compiler is: don't inline and don't optimize. So lets take a look at generated assembly.

On going through the assembly generated form the above code we learn that the for ADD CPU is using LEA.

``` lea eax,[rcx+rdx] ```

Now that we understand that how CPU will handle add lets take a look at higher level language like Python

```python
def add(a, b)
   return a+b

c = add(1234, 5678)
```

After going through the assembly generated by interpreter we learn that there is a lot of waste. It had a LOT of waste instructions, but required due to it's design and nature. A lot of operations were needed to understand which kind of operations we are going to perform ie ADD. And after that a lot of instructions to return the result. Only one instruction was used for our workload. Everything else was waste.

Again the first goal should not be to optimize but rather reduce the waste. In case of python, it created it's own instruction stream generating massive addition instructions for CPU to run. To avoid this you can use addons or plug in precomplied C or use a JIT that turn our loops into streamlined C version.

A CPU should do atleast one instruction per-cycle but on testing this program we get to know it achives only 0.00619 adds per clock cycle and C program takes 0.8 adds per cycle. This is multiple orders faster than python. Its 130x faster.

The conclusion is: Waste results in Slower Performance.
